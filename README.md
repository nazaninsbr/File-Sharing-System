# File-Sharing-System

this is a file sharing system that works with this idea that there are a number of mini-servers connected to a main server, 
when they are connecting they inform the main server of the files they have, then when the client connects to the main server
and asks for some file the main server can connect it to the mini-server that has that file. 

in order to run this project go to the `Nazanin Sabri-810194346` folder and run the codes in that folder, the rest are file parts, test 
and ... .
